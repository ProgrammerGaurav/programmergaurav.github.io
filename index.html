		A computer programmer, sometimes called more recently a coder (especially in more informal contexts), is a
		person who creates computer software. The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of
		computers, or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software.
		A programmer's most oft-used computer language (e.g., Assembly, COBOL, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Lisp, Python) may
		be prefixed to the term programmer. Some who work with web programming languages also prefix their titles with
		web. programmer gaurav
		A range of occupations that involve programming also often require a range of other, similar skills, for
		example: (software) developer, web developer, mobile applications developer, embedded firmware developer,
		software engineer, computer scientist, game programmer, game developer and software analyst. The use of the term
		programmer as applied to these positions is sometimes considered an insulting simplification or even derogatory.
		British countess and mathematician Ada Lovelace is often considered to be the first computer programmer, as she
		was the first to publish part of a program (specifically an algorithm) intended for implementation on Charles
		Babbage's analytical engine, in October 1842. The algorithm was used to calculate Bernoulli numbers.[7] Because
		Babbage's machine was never completed as a functioning standard in Lovelace's time, she unfortunately never had
		the opportunity to see the algorithm in action.
		The ENIAC programming team, consisting of Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas
		and Ruth Lichterman were the first regularly working programmers.[8][9] International Programmers' Day is
		celebrated annually on 7 January.[10] In 2009, the government of Russia decreed a professional annual holiday
		known as Programmers' Day to be celebrated on 13 September (12 September in leap years). It had already been an
		unofficial holiday before that in many countries.
		The word software was used as early as 1953, but did not regularly appear in print until the 1960s.[11] Before
		this time, computers were programmed either by customers or the few commercial computer manufacturers of the
		time, such as UNIVAC and IBM. The first company founded to specifically provide software products and services
		was the Computer Usage Company, in 1955.[12]
		The software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in
		mass-produced quantities. Universities, governments and businesses created a demand for software. Many of these
		programs were written in-house by full-time staff programmers; some were distributed freely between users of a
		particular machine for no charge. And others were developed on a commercial basis. Other firms, such as Computer
		Sciences Corporation (founded in 1959) also started to grow. The computer/hardware manufacturers soon started
		bundling operating systems, system software and programming environments with their machines.[citation needed]
		The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the personal computer ("PC") in the mid-1970s, which brought
		computing to the average office worker. In the following years the PC also helped create a constantly-growing
		market for games, applications and utilities software. CP/M, later replaced by DOS, Microsoft's Windows popular
		operating system of the time.[13] portfolio programmer gaurav
		In the early years of the 21st century, another successful business model has arisen for hosted software, called
		software-as-a-service, or SaaS. From the point of view of producers of some proprietary software, SaaS reduces
		the concerns about unauthorized copying, since it can only be accessed through the Web, and by definition, no
		client software is loaded onto the end user's PC. SaaS is typically run out of the cloud.
		Computer programmers write, test, debug, and maintain the detailed instructions, called computer programs, that
		computers must follow to perform their functions. Programmers also conceive, design, and test logical structures
		for solving problems by computer. Many technical innovations in programming — advanced computing technologies
		and sophisticated new languages and programming tools — have redefined the role of a programmer and elevated
		much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the organization.
		Programmers work in many settings, including corporate information technology ("IT") departments, big software
		companies, small service firms and government entities of all sizes. Many professional programmers also work for
		consulting companies at client sites as contractors. Licensing is not typically required to work as a
		programmer, although professional certifications are commonly held by programmers. Programming is widely
		considered a profession (although some[who?] authorities disagree on the grounds that only careers with legal
		licensing requirements count as a profession).
		Programmers' work varies widely depending on the type of business for which they are writing programs. For
		example, the instructions involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to
		duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in
		a few hours, more complex ones may require more than a year of work, while others are never considered
		'complete' but rather are continuously improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several programmers
		work together as a team under a senior programmer's supervision. portfolio
		A software engineer writing JavaScript portfolio programmer gaurav
		Programmers write programs according to the specifications determined primarily by more senior programmers and
		by systems analysts. After the design process is complete, it is the job of the programmer to convert that
		design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow. The programmer codes these
		instructions in one of many programming languages. Different programming languages are used depending on the
		purpose of the program. COBOL, for example, is commonly used for business applications that typically run on
		mainframe and midrange computers, whereas Fortran is used in science and engineering. C++ and Python are widely
		used for both scientific and business applications. Java, C#, JS and PHP are popular programming languages for
		Web and business applications. Programmers generally know more than one programming language and, because many
		languages are similar, they often can learn new languages relatively easily. In practice, programmers often are
		referred to by the language they know, e.g. as Java programmers, or by the type of function they perform or
		environment in which they work: for example, database programmers, mainframe programmers, or Web developers.
		When making changes to the source code that programs are made up of, programmers need to make other programmers
		aware of the task that the routine is to perform. They do this by inserting comments in the source code so that
		others can understand the program more easily and by documenting their code. To save work, programmers often use
		libraries of basic code that can be modified or customized for a specific application. This approach yields more
		reliable and consistent programs and increases programmers' productivity by eliminating some routine steps.
		Testing and debugging
		Programmers test a program by running it and looking for bugs (errors). As they are identified, the programmer
		usually makes the appropriate corrections, then rechecks the program until an acceptably low level and severity
		of bugs remain. This process is called testing and debugging. These are important parts of every programmer's
		job. Programmers may continue to fix these problems throughout the life of a program. Updating, repairing,
		modifying, and expanding existing programs is sometimes called maintenance programming. Programmers may
		contribute to user guides and online help, or they may work with technical writers to do such work.
		Application versus system programming
		Computer programmers often are grouped into two broad types: application programmers and systems programmers.
		Application programmers write programs to handle a specific job, such as a program to track inventory within an
		organization. They also may revise existing packaged software or customize generic applications which are
		frequently purchased from independent software vendors. Systems programmers, in contrast, write programs to
		maintain and control computer systems software, such as operating systems and database management systems. These
		workers make changes in the instructions that determine how the network, workstations, and CPU of the system
		handle the various jobs they have been given and how they communicate with peripheral equipment such as printers
		and disk drives. programmer gaurav
		Types of software portfolio
		Programmers in software development companies may work directly with experts from various fields to create
		software – either programs designed for specific clients or packaged software for general use – ranging from
		video games to educational software to programs for desktop publishing and financial planning. Programming of
		packaged software constitutes one of the most rapidly growing segments of the computer services industry. Some
		companies or organizations – even small ones – have set up their own IT team to ensure the design and
		development of in-house software to answer to very specific needs from their internal end-users, especially when
		existing software are not suitable or too expensive. This is for example the case in research
		laboratories.[citation needed]
		In some organizations, particularly small ones, people commonly known as programmer analysts are responsible for
		both the systems analysis and the actual programming work. The transition from a mainframe environment to one
		that is based primarily on personal computers (PCs) has blurred the once rigid distinction between the
		programmer and the user. Increasingly, adept end users are taking over many of the tasks previously performed by
		programmers. For example, the growing use of packaged software, such as spreadsheet and database management
		software packages, allows users to write simple programs to access data and perform calculations.[citation
		needed] programmer gaurav
		In addition, the rise of the Internet has made web development a huge part of the programming field. Currently
		more software applications are web applications that can be used by anyone with a web browser.[citation needed]
		Examples of such applications include the Google search service, the Outlook.com e-mail service, and the Flickr
		photo-sharing service. programmer gaurav
		Programming editors, also known as source code editors, are text editors that are specifically designed for
		programmers or developers for writing the source code of an application or a program. Most of these editors
		include features useful for programmers, which may include color syntax highlighting, auto indentation,
		auto-complete, bracket matching, syntax check, and allows plug-ins. These features aid the users during coding,
		debugging and testing.[17] portfolio programmer gaurav
		Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
		Programming can be done using a variety of computer "languages," such as SQL, Java, Python, and C++.
